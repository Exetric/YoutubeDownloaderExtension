# Youtube Downloader Extension

This is a super simple chrome extension I made that replaces the Youtube Premium download button with one that redirects you to ytmp3.cc (Can be changed depending on what website you'd like)

As of right now the extension is not available on the Google Chrome Store, so if you'd like to install it you'll need to do it manually, so here's what you're going to need to do in order to install it.

1.  Download the latest release of the extension on the releases tab of this repository
2.  Unzip the folder called `extension` and place it somewhere where it won't get tampered with or deleted
3.  Go to the extensions page on Chrome `chrome://extensions/`
4.  Enable Developer Mode by ticking the slider on the top right corner of the screen
5.  Click the `Load Unpacked` button on the top left corner of the screen
6.  Locate and select the extension folder

Once this is finished the extension should be installed, feel free to disable Developer Mode now that the extension is installed.
